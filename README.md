### **Project Description (English)**  
This repository contains a <b>sample UI file</b> developed by the <b>RaseTech Team</b> as part of a <b>3rd-year university project</b>.  
The file here is a simplified version — the <b>full program</b> includes more functions and supports both **Forward Kinematics** and **Inverse Kinematics** for robotic arm control.  

The full system is <span style="color:#4caf50; font-weight:bold;">stable, reliable, and well-structured</span>, designed for educational and research use in robotics and automation.
